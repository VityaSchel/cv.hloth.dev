[Website](https://cv.hloth.dev) with links to my resume and CV and changelog of these.

Built with Vite, React, TypeScript; SCSS modules, components inspired by @shadcn/ui's; FSD architecture in 1 hour (I even managed to get in time with last commit). Quick coding with help of GitHub copilot, my own snippets and strict workflow with my own VSCode extensions etc. This is one of my cleanest projects by codebase.
